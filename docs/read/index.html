        <h3>Tips to Catify Your Home</h3>
        <p>Are you ready to catify? Take a look around your home, and evaluate what spaces need to be created or improved to make a feline friendly environment. Think about your personal aesthetic, we want you and your cat to be happy with the results.
        <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/digitrix/48923453826/in/album-72157646788786723/" title="Cat"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48923453826_3552d2cbca_q.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="Cat"></a>
        You also want to make sure the changes you’re making are catering to their deep rooted instincts, replicating areas of their life in the wild. There are many creative and inexpensive ways to catify your home. Below, are guidelines and ideas to get you started.Play and Hunt. It’s so important for this energy to be released. Guardians need to schedule dedicated time for one-on-one play to get their mojo going. Toys that mimic the hunt (air prey and ground prey) are essential. If you’re out of the house for long periods of time, try adding remote interactive toys.</p>
        

        <span class="read-more-target">
            <p> <span class="article-text-important">Space they can claim and perch.</span> Map out a space that will get your cat up off the floor, and create a continuous path that takes them all the way around the room without ever touching the floor (the cat superhighway). Now they have space they can claim as their own. Get creative. You can use cat shelves, your own furniture, odds-and-ends you might find in your garage (a nice trunk, wine crate, etc.). When they have spaces to leave their scent, this reinforces the feeling of “this space is mine,” which fosters a feeling of confidence, security, and comfort.<br>

            <span class="article-text-important">Areas to climb and jump.</span> Outdoor cats love to race-up trees so if you don’t want them climbing on your furniture, you have to give them other places to do so. There are a variety of great cat trees and lounges to choose from. You can also create your own. Try natural objects -- a nice arrangement of large branches, scrap wood, or wood planks from a hardware store. Besides cat shelves, try an antique or natural wood ladder, an assortment of decorative stools, or other visually pleasing objects that are different heights.

        <h3>Before you get a kitten...</h3>
        <p>Congratulations! If a kitten has appeared in your life, or if you’re considering adding a new feline family member to your household, you’ll definitely want to consider these important factors.
        <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/digitrix/43357481215/in/album-72157646788786723/" title="Cats"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1883/43357481215_1a40c66b13_w.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="Cats"></a>
        The Best Place To Adopt A Kitten:
        Your best bet is to adopt from a shelter or rescue. From May to October (or even later), shelters are inundated with unwanted kittens. Chances are good that you can even find a purebred through these sources. You can find wonderful kittens waiting to be adopted through your local ASPCA, check out Petfinder, or look up a breed rescue group. Petsmart and Petco also support local shelters by sponsoring adoptions through their stores.</p>

        <span class="read-more-target">
            <p><span class="article-text-important">Please, please,PLEASE never purchase a kitten from a pet store! </span>
            No matter what the salesperson tells you, it is a stone cold fact that pet stores get their animals from only two places: irresponsible “backyard breeders” who couldn’t be bothered to spay their cat; and commercial mills, where cats spend their lives in cramped, dirty cages with little human contact or veterinary care, solely for the purpose of bringing two or three litters a year into an overcrowded world. Yes, there are kitten mills, although puppy mills are much more common. Persians are common victims of kitten mills. (See Purebred Cat Rescue for more info.) Kittens from either mills or pet stores are likely to have parasites, hidden genetic and health problems, and significant socialization deficiencies. People are often taken in by those pitiful little faces and want to save them, but every well-intentioned “rescue” from a pet store condemns one more mother cat to a horrible life. Suppliers do not care why you bought it–they only know that you just put a big wad of money in their pockets.

        <h3>Aggression in cats</h3>
        
        <p>Is your cat biting and/or attacking you or other people? Aggression in cats is not uncommon, but it’s unusual for it to be serious enough for people to seek professional help. Feline aggression is absolutely treatable; but to do it right may take considerable time and effort.
            <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/digitrix/15073297464/in/album-72157646788786723/" title="Cat"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7478/15073297464_334543d047_w.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="Cat"></a>

            With cat-to-human aggression, the roots almost always lie with the person. Cats who, as kittens, were played with or handled roughly by one or more people, and people who don’t understand cat behavior and unwittingly encourage aggressive behavior, are most often to blame. Jackson has featured many such people on My Cat From Hell. However, pain and other medical conditions can also trigger aggression, so don’t neglect that all-important check-up!

            Indoor enrichment to help stave off boredom and expand territory is a good first step (See Jackson's post on catification).</p>

        <span class="read-more-target">
            <p> <span class="article-text-important">Play/Predatory aggression</span>involves the cat’s normal hunting and killing behaviors.
            In many cats, their play becomes too aggressive because their human companions encouraged that behavior when they were kittens. Rough-housing with bare hands is almost irresistible when kittens are small. Everyone loved that video of the “surprised kitten” on YouTube – who wouldn’t? Unfortunately, though, that’s a good way to teach a kitty that bare hands are (a) threatening, and (b) okay to play with. It’s adorable when they’re little, but when the attacker is 15 pounds with inch-long fangs…not so much! For many adult cats who still play inappropriately, or turn their predatory drive on humans or other animals in the home, the underlying problem is usually boredom and excess energy. Cats who are especially territorial may be also more prone to predatory aggression. To correct the problem, never play rough with your cat, but more importantly, institute regular sessions of Play Therapy.<br>

            <span class="article-text-important">Petting-related / Overstimulation aggression</span>is frustrating and frightening. One minute you’re having a cuddly moment with your sweet furball, and the next minute the cat is going in seven directions at once, and you’re left bleeding from multiple bites or scratches. Cats are highly sensitive creatures, and it may be that there’s just so much stimulation the cat can take; or there are certain “off-limits” areas that are certain to draw blood–from you–if you stray too close. There may be a pain issue, or a bad memory, but whatever the reason, very few cats attack without warning, though it may seem that way. It’s important to become an expert in feline body language.
            Widening or “blackening” of the eyes (dilated pupils), ears turned or laid back, twitching tail, whiskers flattening against the face; these are all signs of impending doom. The trick is to STOP before the cat feels it necessary to take the next step. Never try to restrain the cat! Gently remove all of your vulnerable body parts from the vicinity; or if that’s not possible, try using distraction to shift kitty’s attention to something that can’t be hurt, such as a toy, throw pillow, or rolled-up socks. Be sure to leave such items in strategic locations around the house so there’s always one handy. And, of course, Play Therapy will help diffuse some of the stress and anxiety that may be contributing to the cat’s sensitivity.

        <h3>Cat Introduction Part 1</h3>
        <p>Cat Mojo is largely based around territorial security. So when you bring a new cat into another cat’s home, it can be a complicated affair, based on two x-factors: Your existing cat’s sense of that security—since a new cat has joined the mix—and the newcomer’s, as they attempt to get comfortable in a completely new environment... with another cat.
        <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/digitrix/48859753063/in/album-72157646788786723/" title="Cats"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48859753063_bdfae11b12_w.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="Cats"></a>
        This is why the old common wisdom of introducing cats by “letting them work it out” is not only a recipe for disaster, but it also feeds the belief that cats are solitary creatures who are better left that way. In essence, it’s cat Russian Roulette; they will actually work it out sometimes, but when it doesn’t work, you are triggering the territorial panic switch in your existing cat... which means war. Remember: we are taking an in-depth process, but asking cats to do this in a relatively small, closed territory. This can make the process even trickier.</p>
        <span class="read-more-target">
        <p>With this in mind, I present to you the exact step-by-step introduction strategy I have personally used through the years; a time-tested recipe for successful integration that I’ve seen in action hundreds of times. Be prepared to follow this process to a T, while embracing the slow-and-steady-wins-the-race mantra. Not only are we trying to minimize risks, preventing a long-term lack of trust between the cats, but we also try to go slow to ensure a stronger bond of friendship.<br>
        At the same time, understand that this is definitely not a one-size-fits-all situation. Every introduction unfolds in its own way, and on its own time. Exactly how slow you take things will, of course, depend on how amenable your cats appear to be with this new living arrangement. If things are moving forward harmoniously, then feel free to breeze through the steps—so long as you don’t actually skip any. I have put things in a specific order for very specific reasons.

            <span class="article-text-important">Ready? Set? Let’s go!</span>
